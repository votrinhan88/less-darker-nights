<b>Less Darker Nights mods for Grand Theft Auto V - 1.4.beta</b>

<b>Description:</b>
+ This is a toned-down version of Darker Nights 1.4 by Gelse16 (https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/datafile/40491-darker-nights/) combined with VisualV by _CP_ & robi29 (https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/visualv), which does not use ENB or Shaders. I find it too dark so I made my custom configs based on the both mods.
+ Let's just say most credits go to VisualV and Darker Nights. I only write the Python codes to compose interpolated values between their configs.
+ I included a wide range of darker settings (20% to 80%) between VisualV and Darker Nights.
+ Tested on GTA V version 1.69.
+ This mod is for singleplayer only! DO NOT USE MODS ONLINE OR YOU WILL GET BANNED!!!

<b>Installation:</b>
1. Always make backup first!
2. Download VisualV by _CP_ & robi29 (https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/visualv)
3. Extract VisualV.oiv separately (NOT install by OpenIV) and copy their timecycle .xml files in update/update.rpf/common/data/timecycles to mods/update/update.rpf/common/data/timecycles.
____+ This is because we use VisualV as a base, and certain weather are not modified by Darker Nights.
4. Drop all (10 .xml) files located in Less Darker Nights ./composed/% into mods/update/update.rpf/common/data/timecycles.
____+ Darker Nights modified these files, but I have toned down the darkness.
____+ Recommended settings: 80% darker-nights - 20% visualv.

<b>Uninstallation: (Reverting to vanilla values)</b>
1. Download VisualV by _CP_ & robi29 (https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/visualv).
2. Extract Original files.oiv separately (NOT install by OpenIV) and copy their timecycle .xml files in update/update.rpf/common/data/timecycles to mods/update/update.rpf/common/data/timecycles.
